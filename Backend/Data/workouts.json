If you use the latter, begin by placing them side-by-side in front of you. Step between them with your leading foot. If flexibility prevents lifting from the floor, start with the weights at your sides while standing. LIFT: With the weight on your working leg, and your off leg extending backwards for balance, bend at the hips, while keeping a neutral spinal curve. Descend until your chest is parallel to the floor, then return to the starting position. EMPHASIS: Brace through your core at all times. Keep a neutral spine throughout the duration of the movement - if a neutral spine cannot be maintained, either reduce the weight or shorten the range of motion.

MOVEMENT: Curl your arms up to your chest, keeping your elbows at your side and eyes straight ahead. Use your leg to press against the towel and provide appropriate tension throughout the range of motion of the exercise. Do not let your upper back round over - consciously pull your shoulder blades together to provide a stable base for your arms to pull from. It may take a few practice reps, or even sets, to get the feel of this exercise. EMPHASIS: Do not swing - keep your core tight and a neutral spine."

EMPHASIS: Do not swing - your back should move very little from the starting position. BENEFITS: The primary target of the pulldown is the latissimus dorsi.

Return the weight back to the starting position under control. As you pull, cue yourself to push your elbows down, which will increase involvement from the lats. EMPHASIS: Do not swing - your back should move very little from the starting position. BENEFITS: The primary target of the pulldown is the latissimus dorsi. While the middle back is also involved to a lesser degree in the exercise, the vertical nature of the pull tends to take the muscles of the mid back out of the movement."

MOVEMENT: Keeping the back leg straight, drive upwards through the forward leg and gently place your off-leg onto the bench. Step down under complete control, flexing through the lead knee and bracing through the core. EMPHASIS: The top leg should perform all of the work in the step-up. While pushing with the back leg will allow you to lift more weight, it will degrade the purpose of the exercise. REPETITIONS: Perform all prescribed reps on one side, then on the other. This counts as one set. BENEFITS: Step-Ups are a great exercise for training the VMO (Vastus Medialis Oblique) - one of the component muscles of the quadriceps that crosses the knee joint and is important in maintaining knee stability. If your knees cave inwards while squatting or when landing while jumping, the VMO may be weak and the step-up an excellent choice."

Focus on bringing the shoulder blades together at the end of the range of movement. Return to the start position under control, maintaining the same braced position in your torso. EMPHASIS: Do not flex or bend the spine at any point. Keep the hips and lumbar spine locked in place - all of the movement should come from the shoulder blades and in the arms. Also do not push the head forward at the end of the movement - focus on completing the range of motion in the shoulder blades. BENEFITS: The cable row is a great movement for shoulder girdle health and for creating balance in horizontal pulling and pushing (especially for the frequent bench-presser). It is also a bit easier to maintain proper form than in dumbbell, bent-over or chest-supported rows where the tendency and ease of 'cheating' the movement is a bit higher."

Any existing inflexibilities or postural problems can cause problems in the running stride and increase the risk of repetitive strain injuries. Basic running form should include the following - hips that point forwards and not excessively downwards; arms at your sides bent to 90 degrees at the elbows; arm swing primarily forward and back with some - but not excessive - rotation across the body. Do not clench your fists or incline your torso too far forward. Be sure to land each stride with bent knees. The heel should rise above the knee on the recoil of each stride, while the knees should move predominantly forward on each stride. Whether to land on your heel or forefoot is beyond the scope of this explanation - but if you do experience pains or discomforts while running, you should examine which form of striding may be more appropriate for you. CAUTION: Common problems with running include running completely upright, overstriding - that is, landing with your foot in front of your hip rather than underneath, and cycling your arms only forwards and backwards with no rotation (and alternatively, at the other end, moving the arms too far across the body)."

Focus on bringing the shoulder blades together at the end of the range of movement. Return to the start position under control, maintaining the same braced position in your torso. EMPHASIS: Do not flex or bend the spine at any point. Keep the hips and lumbar spine locked in place - all of the movement should come from the shoulder blades and in the arms. Also do not push the head forward at the end of the movement - focus on completing the range of motion in the shoulder blades. BENEFITS: The cable row is a great movement for shoulder girdle health and for creating balance in horizontal pulling and pushing (especially for the frequent bench-presser). It is also a bit easier to maintain proper form than in dumbbell, bent-over or chest-supported rows where the tendency and ease of 'cheating' the movement is a bit higher."

With each position, extend as far as is comfortable and natural, the goal is not to force extreme range of motion, but rather to prepare the spine and back for more work. BENEFITS: The cat camel can help increase thoracic spine (middle/upper back) mobility and is useful for warming up and protecting the spine.

Focus on bringing the shoulder blades together at the end of the range of movement. Return to the start position under control, maintaining the same braced position in your torso. EMPHASIS: Do not flex or bend the spine at any point. Keep the hips and lumbar spine locked in place - all of the movement should come from the shoulder blades and in the arms. Also do not push the head forward at the end of the movement - focus on completing the range of motion in the shoulder blades. BENEFITS: The cable row is a great movement for shoulder girdle health and for creating balance in horizontal pulling and pushing (especially for the frequent bench-presser).

Set your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart and point your toes out slightly - in-line with your knees. Duck underneath and in front of the bar, raise your chest, brace your stomach and establish a netural spine posture. Grip the bar with your hands at roughly twice shoulder width. Select the grip that gives you the most control and stability. LIFT: From this position lift the bar out of the pins driving through the legs. While maintaining a neutral spine position and tight brace through the core, descend until your upper legs are parallel to the floor. Drive the weight up in a straight-line. EMPHASIS: Brace through your core at all times. Keep a neutral spine throughout the duration of the movement - if a neutral spine cannot be maintained, either reduce the weight or shorten the range of motion. Do not let the knees cave inward on the movement."

Keep the shoulders back, get the hips low - but not lower than the knees, push the chest out, and look straight ahead. Grasp the bar at roughly double shoulder width (aim to place them as apart as your elbows are at full extension to your sides). Brace through the core and maintain a strong neutral spine curve. LIFT: To begin the lift push through the heels. When the bar passes the knees begin to push your hips forward, reaching full hip-extension at the end of the lift. Lower the bar close to the body and under control. Maintain the neutral spine position throughout. EMPHASIS: Do not round the back - particularly the lower back - at any time; the spine should be neutral throughout the movement. Do not hyperextend your lower back at the end portion of the movement - the lockout should come from the hips. Instead cue to fire your glutes at the end of the movement. Also be sure to keep the arms straight for the entire movement - there should be no bend in the elbows. The pull should be a coordinated movement and the shoulders should rise at the same speed as the hips. CAUTION: Before deadlifting - and especially snatch grip deadlifting which requires greater range of motion, make sure that you have adequate hip mobility. That is, make sure you are able to grasp the loaded barbell from the ground by hinging at your hips and keeping your back straight, and that you do not have to bend your lower back to achieve that range of motion. If you are unable to achieve this motion, you may need to 1) stretch your hip flexors and 2) begin implementing some light mobilization exercises for the hips. In the meantime you can train the posterior chain with other exercises, or perform the deadlift elevated from blocks or pins where the start position is still within the range of your safe mobility."

CAUTION: If you have a history of flexion-intolerance in your back (and you are not a professional rower), the row is a poor choice and you should swap this exercise for an extension-based conditioning exercise like swimming."

With your knees slightly bent, spine neutral and shoulder blades together, bend at the hips to grasp the handle. Brace through the core before beginning the movement. LIFT: Pull the handle to your chest, keeping your back upright and tight throughout the movement. Focus on bringing the shoulder blades together at the end of the range of movement. Return to the start position under control, maintaining the same braced position in your torso. EMPHASIS: Do not flex or bend the spine at any point. Keep the hips and lumbar spine locked in place - all of the movement should come from the shoulder blades and in the arms. Also do not push the head forward at the end of the movement - focus on completing the range of motion in the shoulder blades. BENEFITS: The cable row is a great movement for shoulder girdle health and for creating balance in horizontal pulling and pushing (especially for the frequent bench-presser). It is also a bit easier to maintain proper form than in dumbbell, bent-over or chest-supported rows where the tendency and ease of 'cheating' the movement is a bit higher."

REPETITIONS: Perform all prescribed reps on one side, then on the other. This counts as one set. BENEFITS: The side bridge is an excellent exercise for the abdominals and for training trunk stabilization. It is one tool to help improve force transmission from the lower to the upper body, as well as improve posture and reduce the risk of back injuries. STRENGTH CRITERIA: You must be able to perform a side bridge from the knees before progressing to a full side bridge."

Any existing inflexibilities or postural problems can cause problems in the running stride and increase the risk of repetitive strain injuries. Basic running form should include the following - hips that point forwards and not excessively downwards; arms at your sides bent to 90 degrees at the elbows; arm swing primarily forward and back with some - but not excessive - rotation across the body. Do not clench your fists or incline your torso too far forward. Be sure to land each stride with bent knees. The heel should rise above the knee on the recoil of each stride, while the knees should move predominantly forward on each stride. Whether to land on your heel or forefoot is beyond the scope of this explanation - but if you do experience pains or discomforts while running, you should examine which form of striding may be more appropriate for you. CAUTION: Common problems with running include running completely upright, overstriding - that is, landing with your foot in front of your hip rather than underneath, and cycling your arms only forwards and backwards with no rotation (and alternatively, at the other end, moving the arms too far across the body)."

With each position, extend as far as is comfortable and natural, the goal is not to force extreme range of motion, but rather to prepare the spine and back for more work. BENEFITS: The cat camel can help increase thoracic spine (middle/upper back) mobility and is useful for warming up and protecting the spine. It accomplishes 'spinal flossing' - essentially lubricating it and preparing it for more strenuous activities."

Any existing inflexibilities or postural problems can cause problems in the running stride and increase the risk of repetitive strain injuries. Basic running form should include the following - hips that point forwards and not excessively downwards; arms at your sides bent to 90 degrees at the elbows; arm swing primarily forward and back with some - but not excessive - rotation across the body. Do not clench your fists or incline your torso too far forward. Be sure to land each stride with bent knees. The heel should rise above the knee on the recoil of each stride, while the knees should move predominantly forward on each stride. Whether to land on your heel or forefoot is beyond the scope of this explanation - but if you do experience pains or discomforts while running, you should examine which form of striding may be more appropriate for you. CAUTION: Common problems with running include running completely upright, overstriding - that is, landing with your foot in front of your hip rather than underneath, and cycling your arms only forwards and backwards with no rotation (and alternatively, at the other end, moving the arms too far across the body)."

Brace through the core and maintain a strong neutral spine curve. The bar should be much closer to your hips at the start of the movement than in the traditional deadlift. LIFT: To begin the lift push through the heels. When the bar passes the knees begin to push your hips forward, reaching full hip-extension at the end of the lift. Lower the bar close to the body and under control. Maintain the neutral spine position throughout. EMPHASIS: Do not round the back - particularly the lower back - at any time; the spine should be neutral throughout the movement. Do not hyperextend your lower back at the end portion of the movement - the lockout should come from the hips. Instead cue to fire your glutes at the end of the movement. Also be sure to keep the arms straight for the entire movement - there should be no bend in the elbows. The pull should be a coordinated movement and the shoulders should rise at the same speed as the hips. CAUTION: Before deadlifting, make sure that you have adequate hip mobility. That is, make sure you are able to grasp the loaded barbell from the ground by hinging at your hips and keeping your back straight, and that you do not have to bend your lower back to achieve that range of motion. If you are unable to achieve this motion, you may need to 1) stretch your hip flexors and 2) begin implementing some light mobilization exercises for the hips. In the meantime you can train the posterior chain with other exercises, or perform the deadlift elevated from blocks or pins where the start position is still within the range of your safe mobility."

Select the grip that gives you the most control and stability. Now lift the bar out of the pins driving through the legs. LIFT: While maintaining a neutral spine position and tight brace through the core, descend as far as possible without rounding your lower back. For most this will be when the hips are 3-12 inches below the knees. Drive the weight up in a straight-line. EMPHASIS: Brace through your core at all times.

Keep the shoulders back, get the hips low - but not lower than the knees, push the chest out, and look straight ahead. Grasp the bar at roughly double shoulder width (aim to place them as apart as your elbows are at full extension to your sides). Brace through the core and maintain a strong neutral spine curve. LIFT: To begin the lift push through the heels. When the bar passes the knees begin to push your hips forward, reaching full hip-extension at the end of the lift. Lower the bar close to the body and under control. Maintain the neutral spine position throughout. EMPHASIS: Do not round the back - particularly the lower back - at any time; the spine should be neutral throughout the movement. Do not hyperextend your lower back at the end portion of the movement - the lockout should come from the hips. Instead cue to fire your glutes at the end of the movement. Also be sure to keep the arms straight for the entire movement - there should be no bend in the elbows. The pull should be a coordinated movement and the shoulders should rise at the same speed as the hips. CAUTION: Before deadlifting - and especially snatch grip deadlifting which requires greater range of motion, make sure that you have adequate hip mobility. That is, make sure you are able to grasp the loaded barbell from the ground by hinging at your hips and keeping your back straight, and that you do not have to bend your lower back to achieve that range of motion. If you are unable to achieve this motion, you may need to 1) stretch your hip flexors and 2) begin implementing some light mobilization exercises for the hips. In the meantime you can train the posterior chain with other exercises, or perform the deadlift elevated from blocks or pins where the start position is still within the range of your safe mobility."

Brace through the core before beginning the movement. LIFT: Pull the handle to your chest, keeping your back upright and tight throughout the movement. Focus on bringing the shoulder blades together at the end of the range of movement. Return to the start position under control, maintaining the same braced position in your torso. EMPHASIS: Do not flex or bend the spine at any point. Keep the hips and lumbar spine locked in place - all of the movement should come from the shoulder blades and in the arms. Also do not push the head forward at the end of the movement - focus on completing the range of motion in the shoulder blades. BENEFITS: The cable row is a great movement for shoulder girdle health and for creating balance in horizontal pulling and pushing (especially for the frequent bench-presser). It is also a bit easier to maintain proper form than in dumbbell, bent-over or chest-supported rows where the tendency and ease of 'cheating' the movement is a bit higher."

Standing sideways to the platform, brace through the core, pull your shoulder blades back and establish a neutral spine position. Lift your foot which is on the far side of the box and cross it in front of your other leg onto the box. MOVEMENT: Place your weight across the heel of the elevated foot, press through it, and raise your other leg up and onto the box. Drive through the raised leg and do not attempt to push off using the other side. Make sure that the knee of your elevated leg tracks in a line with your toes. Lower the off leg back to the start position under control on each repetition. Be sure to repeat the exercise on the opposite side. REPETITIONS: Perform all prescribed reps on one side, then on the other. This counts as one set. OPTIONAL WEIGHTING: When you are ready (and there is no reason to push for high weights on this exercise), the movement may also be weighted with dumbbells, barbells, chains and weight vests. If you have access to them, the chains and weight vests are the least obtrusive method. ASSISTS: While starting the movement it may help to use a shorter box and build up the height over time. BENEFITS: The crossover step-up is an excellent exercise for training the glutes in both rotation and hip abduction. It is also a great frontal plane exercise for athletics."

MOVEMENT: Keeping the back leg straight, drive upwards through the forward leg and gently place your off-leg onto the bench. Step down under complete control, flexing through the lead knee and bracing through the core. EMPHASIS: The top leg should perform all of the work in the step-up. While pushing with the back leg will allow you to lift more weight, it will degrade the purpose of the exercise. REPETITIONS: Perform all prescribed reps on one side, then on the other.

Hold your legs in this position for the duration of the exercise. Now lift yourself up until your chin is over the bar, trying to get as high as possible.

Focus on bringing the shoulder blades together at the end of the range of movement. Return to the start position under control, maintaining the same braced position in your torso. EMPHASIS: Do not flex or bend the spine at any point. Keep the hips and lumbar spine locked in place - all of the movement should come from the shoulder blades and in the arms. Also do not push the head forward at the end of the movement - focus on completing the range of motion in the shoulder blades. BENEFITS: The cable row is a great movement for shoulder girdle health and for creating balance in horizontal pulling and pushing (especially for the frequent bench-presser). It is also a bit easier to maintain proper form than in dumbbell, bent-over or chest-supported rows where the tendency and ease of 'cheating' the movement is a bit higher."

With your knees slightly bent, spine neutral and shoulder blades together, bend at the hips to grasp the handle. Grip the handle underhand at shoulder width. Brace through the core before beginning the movement. LIFT: Pull the handle to your chest, keeping your back upright and tight throughout the movement. Focus on bringing the shoulder blades together at the end of the range of movement. Return to the start position under control, maintaining the same braced position in your torso. EMPHASIS: Do not flex or bend the spine at any point. Keep the hips and lumbar spine locked in place - all of the movement should come from the shoulder blades and in the arms. Also do not push the head forward at the end of the movement - focus on completing the range of motion in the shoulder blades. BENEFITS: The cable row is a great movement for shoulder girdle health and for creating balance in horizontal pulling and pushing (especially for the frequent bench-presser). It is also a bit easier to maintain proper form than in dumbbell, bent-over or chest-supported rows where the tendency and ease of 'cheating' the movement is a bit higher."

Return the weight back to the starting position under control. As you pull, cue yourself to push your elbows down, which will increase involvement from the lats. EMPHASIS: Do not swing - your back should move very little from the starting position. BENEFITS: The primary target of the pulldown is the latissimus dorsi.

Any existing inflexibilities or postural problems can cause problems in the running stride and increase the risk of repetitive strain injuries. Basic running form should include the following - hips that point forwards and not excessively downwards; arms at your sides bent to 90 degrees at the elbows; arm swing primarily forward and back with some - but not excessive - rotation across the body. Do not clench your fists or incline your torso too far forward. Be sure to land each stride with bent knees. The heel should rise above the knee on the recoil of each stride, while the knees should move predominantly forward on each stride. Whether to land on your heel or forefoot is beyond the scope of this explanation - but if you do experience pains or discomforts while running, you should examine which form of striding may be more appropriate for you. CAUTION: Common problems with running include running completely upright, overstriding - that is, landing with your foot in front of your hip rather than underneath, and cycling your arms only forwards and backwards with no rotation (and alternatively, at the other end, moving the arms too far across the body)."

Hold for time. ASSISTS: Using parallel bars or hex dumbbells allows for a slightly easier grip. BENEFITS: The planche is a great exercise for developing strength, coordination and stability. It is also very difficult, and its variations are a great way to get a challenging workout without equipment. CAUTION: Make sure you have worked up to the planche with appropriate progressions - it is a very challenging exercise and it is easy to hurt yourself if you do not have appropriate levels of strength.
